# Real-Time Object Detection with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using machine learning techniques. It includes a Jupyter Notebook that showcases the implementation of a language model for object detection tasks.

## Project Structure

- `language_model.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the implementation details of the language model used for object detection.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (as specified in the notebook)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AMROSE-SAKARIA/realtime_obj_detection_mL.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd realtime_obj_detection_mL
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook language_model.ipynb

## Working

The language_model.ipynb notebook focuses on using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) for object detection. Here's how it works:

### Data Preparation 
The notebook begins by importing and preparing datasets (e.g., images, videos) for object detection. You can load datasets from local storage or publicly available datasets.

### Pre-processing
The images and data are pre-processed to make them ready for training. This includes resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and possibly augmenting the data to improve model accuracy.

### Model Training
A language model, likely based on pre-trained models or deep learning techniques like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN, is used to detect objects in real-time. The notebook details the training process and the model architecture.

### Real-Time Inference
Once the model is trained, it performs real-time inference on new images or video streams. The model detects and classifies objects, and the results (bounding boxes and labels) are visualized.

### Evaluation
The notebook assesses the model's performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the intersection-over-union (IoU) score.

### Results Visualization
The final output is displayed, showing the objects detected in the images or videos along with the confidence scores and bounding boxes.
